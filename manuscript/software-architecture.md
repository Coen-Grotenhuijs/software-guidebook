## Software Architecture {#software-architecture}

This section provides an overview of the techtribes.je software architecture.

### Containers

The following diagram shows the logical containers that make up the techtribes.je system. The diagram does not represent the physical number and location of containers - please see the [infrastructure](#infrastructure-architecture) and [deployment](#deployment) sections for this information.

- __Web Application__: an Apache Tomcat 7 web server that is the single point of access for the techtribes.je website from the Internet.
- __Content Updater__: a standalone Java 7 application that updates information from Twitter, GitHub and blogs.
- __Relational Database__: a MySQL database that stores the majority of the data behind the techtribes.je website.
- __NoSQL Data Store__: a MongoDB database that stores the tweets and blog posts.
- __File System__: the file system stores Lucene search indexes.

### Components - Content Updater 

The following diagram shows the components that make up the standalone Content Updater.

In addition to some core components (detailed later), the standalone Content Updater process consists of the following components:

 - __Scheduled Content Updater__: This component orchestrates the update of information from Twitter, GitHub and blogs on a scheduled basis (i.e. every fifteen minutes). It also recalculates the "recent activity" and awards badges once per hour. It's a Spring Bean that uses the Spring scheduling annotations. See [je.techtribes.component.scheduledcontentupdater](https://github.com/techtribesje/techtribesje/tree/master/techtribes-updater/src/je/techtribes/component/scheduledcontentupdater) for the code.
 - __Twitter Connector__:  This component is responsible for connecting to Twitter in order to refresh profile information and retrieve tweets. It's a Spring Bean that uses the [Twitter4J library](http://twitter4j.org). Both of the REST and streaming APIs are used. See [je.techtribes.component.twitterconnector](https://github.com/techtribesje/techtribesje/tree/master/techtribes-updater/src/je/techtribes/component/twitterconnector) for the code.
 - __GitHub Connector__:  This component is responsible for connecting to GitHub in order to refresh repository information. It's a Spring Bean that uses the [Eclipse Mylyn GitHub connector](http://www.eclipse.org/mylyn/). See [je.techtribes.component.githubconnector](https://github.com/techtribesje/techtribesje/tree/master/techtribes-updater/src/je/techtribes/component/githubconnector) for the code.
 - __News Feed Connector__:  This component is responsible for connecting to RSS/Atom feeds in order to refresh the news and blog posts aggregated into the techtribes.je website. It's a Spring Bean that uses the [ROME library](http://rometools.github.io/rome/). See [je.techtribes.component.newsfeedconnector](https://github.com/techtribesje/techtribesje/tree/master/techtribes-updater/src/je/techtribes/component/newsfeedconnector) for the code.

### Components - Core 

The following diagram shows the common components that are used by the Web Server and the standalone Content Updater.

Here is a brief summary of each core component:

- __Content Source Component__: This component provides access to information about people and tribes (together, referred to as "content sources"), which are stored in MySQL. See [je.techtribes.component.contentsource](https://github.com/techtribesje/techtribesje/tree/master/techtribes-core/src/je/techtribes/component/contentsource) for the code. 
- __News Feed Entry Component__: This component provides access to news and blog posts, which are stored in MongoDB. See [je.techtribes.component.newsfeedentry](https://github.com/techtribesje/techtribesje/tree/master/techtribes-core/src/je/techtribes/component/newsfeedentry) for the code. 
- __Tweet Component__: This component provides access to tweets, which are stored in MongoDB. See [je.techtribes.component.tweet](https://github.com/techtribesje/techtribesje/tree/master/techtribes-core/src/je/techtribes/component/tweet) for the code. 
- __Talk Component__: This component provides access to information about talks by local speakers, which are stored in MySQL. See [je.techtribes.component.talk](https://github.com/techtribesje/techtribesje/tree/master/techtribes-core/src/je/techtribes/component/talk) for the code. 
- __Event Component__: This component provides access to information about local events (e.g. meetups, seminars, coding dojos, etc), which are stored in MySQL. See [je.techtribes.component.event](https://github.com/techtribesje/techtribesje/tree/master/techtribes-core/src/je/techtribes/component/event) for the code. 
- __Job Component__: This component provides access to information about local job openings, which are stored in MySQL. See [je.techtribes.component.job](https://github.com/techtribesje/techtribesje/tree/master/techtribes-core/src/je/techtribes/component/job) for the code. 
- __GitHub Component__: This component provides access to information about code repositories belonging to local people/tribes, which are stored in MySQL. See [je.techtribes.component.github](https://github.com/techtribesje/techtribesje/tree/master/techtribes-core/src/je/techtribes/component/github) for the code. 
- __Search Component__: This component provides search facilities across the news, blog posts and tweets. Apache Lucene is used for the indexing and searching. See [je.techtribes.component.search](https://github.com/techtribesje/techtribesje/tree/master/techtribes-core/src/je/techtribes/component/search) for the code. 
- __Activity Component__: This component provides access to the "recent activity" information, which is stored in MySQL and calculated by the Content Updater component. See [je.techtribes.component.activity](https://github.com/techtribesje/techtribesje/tree/master/techtribes-core/src/je/techtribes/component/activity) for the code. 
- __Badge Component__: This component provides access to the badges that have been awarded to people/tribes as a result of their activity. See [je.techtribes.component.badge](https://github.com/techtribesje/techtribesje/tree/master/techtribes-core/src/je/techtribes/component/badge) for the code. 
- __Logging Component__: This is a simple wrapper around Commons Logging and log4j. It's used by all other components. See [je.techtribes.component.log](https://github.com/techtribesje/techtribesje/tree/master/techtribes-core/src/je/techtribes/component/log) for the code.
