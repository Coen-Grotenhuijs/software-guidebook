### Performance

All pages on techtribes.je should load and render in under five seconds, for fifty concurrent users.

### Scalability

The techtribes.je website should be able to scale to ten times the current data volumes, as follows:

 - 500,000 tweets
 - 10,000 news/blog posts 

### Security

Although most of the techtribes.je website can be viewed by anonymous users, it must provide role-based access to allow people/tribes to log-in and manage their profile. In order to reduce the operational support overhead associated with managing user credentials, all authentication must be done via a third-party mechanism such as Twitter, Facebook, Google, OpenID, etc.

### Localisation

All information will be formatted for the British English locale only.

### Browser compatibility

The techtribes.je website should work consistently across the following browsers:
