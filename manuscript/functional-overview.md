## Functional Overview {#sample-guidebook-functional-overview}

This section provides a summary of the functionality provided by the [techtribes.je](http://techtribes.je) website.

### People and Tribes

At the core of [techtribes.je](http://techtribes.je) are people and tribes:

- **People**: these are people in the local tech, digital and IT sector.
- **Tribes**: a tribe is a group of people and there are 4 types:
  - **Business**: a business tribe represents a local company.
  - **Tech**: a tech tribe is a group of people with a common interest in a particular topic (e.g. Java, Raspberry Pi, SharePoint, etc).
  - **Media**: a media tribe is an organisation who publishes local news.
  - **Community**: a community tribe represents a local user group or other non-profit organisation.

People and tribes have some basic profile information along with a Twitter ID and one or more links to RSS/Atom feeds that [techtribes.je](http://techtribes.je) uses to aggregate content into the website.

### Content

[techtribes.je](http://techtribes.je) aggregates and publishes a number of different types of content, all of which is associated with either a person or a tribe.

#### Blog posts and Tweets

The major function that [techtribes.je](http://techtribes.je) performs is to aggregate blog posts and tweets from people and tribes, allowing users of the website to find that content in one place. Blog posts and tweets can be viewed in a number of ways on the website plus there's also a search feature. A single, consolidated RSS feed of *all* blog posts is published by the website too.

#### News

Local tech news items are simply blog posts by media tribes. Again, these can can be viewed in a number of ways on the website.

[techtribes.je](http://techtribes.je) publishes information about the various talks that local people do at conferences, meetups and other events. Each talk has some basic information (i.e. title, abstract, date plus event details) and is associated with a person.

#### Events

[techtribes.je](http://techtribes.je) also publishes information about local tech events, meetups, user groups, etc. Each event has some basic information (i.e. title, description, date, time, event URL, etc) and is associated with a tribe. 

#### Jobs

Finally, [techtribes.je](http://techtribes.je) lists local tech jobs. A job has some basic information (i.e. title, description, date posted, a URL for more information, etc) and is again associated with a tribe.

### Users

There are three types of users.

#### Anonymous Users

Anonymous users represent anybody visiting [techtribes.je](http://techtribes.je) and they have the ability to view all of the content on the website in a number of different ways.

#### Authenticated Users

Local people who are listed on [techtribes.je](http://techtribes.je) can sign-in with their Twitter ID in order to manage some basic profile information and the list of tech tribes they are a member of.

#### Admin Users

Admin users are simply authenticated users that have been assigned an additional role to perform some basic administration on the website. This includes adding people and tribes to the website, plus managing tribe membership.

### Gaming Engine

The final major function that [techtribes.je](http://techtribes.je) provides is a simple gaming engine to encourage local people and tribes to engage with other members of the community and share content more often.

#### Points

Points are awarded to people and tribes for tweeting, blogging, doing talks and organising events. The points over a seven day period are calculated on an rolling basis to produce a list of who is the most active.

#### Badges

In addition to points, badges are awarded to people and tribes for specific achievements. This includes simple things such as tweeting and blogging through to appearing in the top 3 on the most active list and doing a talk off-island.
