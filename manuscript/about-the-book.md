# About the book

This is the software guidebook for the [techtribes.je](http://techtribes.je) website; a content aggregator for the tech, IT and digital sector in Jersey, Channel Islands. The code behind the techtribes.je website is [open source and available on GitHub](https://github.com/techtribesje/techtribesje). The source for this book is also [open source and available on GitHub](https://github.com/techtribesje/software-guidebook).

This book is based upon the concept of a [software guidebook](https://leanpub.com/software-architecture-for-developers/read#software-guidebook) as described in my [Software Architecture for Developers](https://leanpub.com/software-architecture-for-developers) book. The software guidebook is a lightweight, pragmatic way to document the "big picture" of a software system.
